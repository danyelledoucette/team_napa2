There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates.

Citrus and spice linger nicely on the finish. Drink now.",Organic,@JoeCz

Notes of green peppercorns and pipe tobacco ease into raspberry fruit, made more complex through whole-bunch fermentation. The wine's silky texture is an added treat. This has the potential to be really interesting as it evolves through at least 2025.",Mea Culpa,@JoeCz

Baking spices accent mocha and cassis in this full-bodied wine, which features a velvety texture and long finish. Drink 2020–2030, and possibly beyond.",Abercrombie,@JoeCz

The oak is wonderfully understated, which allows the fruit complexity to shine and leaves the fruit tannins to glide easily across the palate. Drink now–2025.",Mea Culpa,@JoeCz

The result is a top-notch dry Aussie Riesling that's just entering its plateau of maturity, where it should stay for another 5–10 years. Slightly honeyed notes soften the intense scents of crushed stones, then pick up hints of tangerine on the palate. Replacing the briskness of youth is a soft, lingering finish.",The Contours Museum Reserve,@JoeCz
