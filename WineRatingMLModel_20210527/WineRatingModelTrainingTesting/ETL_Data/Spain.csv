Round, staunch and tannic on the palate, this single-vineyard Tinto Fino tastes toasted, blackened and minty, with blackberry, peppercorn and licorice flavors; hold until 2017.",Christina,@wineschach
128984,128984,Spain,Levante,Alicante,Enrique Mendoza,Enrique Mendoza 2006 Santa Rosa Reserva Red (Alicante),Red Blend,50.0,93,Michael Schachner,"For a mature, high-end taste of the Levante, this blend of 70% Cabernet with 15% each of Merlot and Syrah is at the top of the heap. It smells exotic and smooth, like sandalwood, baked berries and brandied plums. On the palate it feels firm and secure, with juicy, deep flavors of cassis and slow-cooked black cherry. This is a bullish red to drink now.",Santa Rosa Reserva,@wineschach

The palate, somewhat surprisingly, is much sharper than the nose, with tangy, zesty flavors of red fruits that some might adore and others will label too thin and sour. Sheer but fresh on the finish, with pulsing acidity. Personally, I find this rather sharp and wanting, given the origin.",Torre de Golbán Reserva,@wineschach

In the mouth, however, this is super tannic and like gravel. Dark berry flavors are well oaked, while the finish tastes of blackberry and chocolate but feels tannic as nails.

Heavy and wide on the palate, with a soft, chunky foundation, this blend of Tempranillo and Merlot tastes of raisin, vanilla, tobacco and cherry liqueur.

Perpetual deals freshly laid asphalt, cola and grilled char on the nose and then follows that up with black cherry, cassis and tobacco flavors. It's pure and ripe more than intellectual.
